basically find when the slope of the cumulative return percentage of the stock reverse direction

if it starts going up and it previously cross the s&P 500 while the slope of the cumulative return percentage of the stock was negative, then buy

if it starts going down and it previously cross the s&P 500 while the slope of the cumulative return percentage of the stock was positive, then sell

and then only buy once until it crosses the s&P again, and then only sell once until it crosses the s&p again

i don't want just one buy and one sell total, i want one buy as in the first buy after it dips below the s&P and then one sell as in the first sell after it climbs across the s&p

the buys sell signals just don't update continuously to handle a new graph
